        <Paragraph>
          Every time I've onboarded a service at work without existing
          observability I've had to rebuild the same thing: a CloudWatch
          dashboard, a handful of alarms, a set of Logs Insights queries. It
          takes a day, it looks slightly different every time, and the next
          person to own the service has to reverse-engineer what the alarms
          actually mean.{" "}
          <TextLink href={repoUrl} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
            aws-observability-dashboard
          </TextLink>{" "}
          is my attempt to package that into something reusable.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The idea is simple: pass in your ECS service ARN, ALB ARN, and log
          groups, and get back a consistent observability package - dashboards,
          alarms, Logs Insights queries, optional canaries. Everything lives
          natively in CloudWatch. No extra service to deploy or maintain.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>What Gets Created</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          A single <InlineHighlight>terraform apply</InlineHighlight> produces
          four things:
        </Paragraph>

        <TextList>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>1 CloudWatch dashboard</Strong> - a composed view with

          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>7+ CloudWatch alarms</Strong> - covering ALB front-door

          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>10 Logs Insights saved queries</Strong> - error analysis,
            P99 latency by route, top failing routes, noisy callers, and

          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>

            outside-in endpoint monitoring with active tracing support.
          </TextListItem>
        </TextList>

        <SectionHeading>Data Flow</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The package observes signals that already exist in CloudWatch. It
          doesn't instrument your application - it reads from the metrics and
          logs your AWS infrastructure already produces.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={dataFlow} />

        <Paragraph>
          The only thing you supply is the signal - structured JSON logs to
          CloudWatch Logs, and the standard CloudWatch metrics that ECS and ALB
          emit by default. The module wires those signals into the dashboard and
          alarm definitions for you.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>Module Structure</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The repo is split into core modules and adapters. The core modules are
          the building blocks - each one owns one concern. The adapters compose
          them into a single call that makes sense for a specific workload
          pattern.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={moduleStructure} />

        <Paragraph>
          For most use cases you'll only interact with{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>platform_service</InlineHighlight>, the recommended
          public adapter. It takes the full set of inputs - service ARNs, log
          groups, alert routing, canary config - and handles the wiring
          internally.
        </Paragraph>

        <Banner title="Why ARN-first?" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            I wanted the module to be safe to add to an existing stack without
            touching anything that's already running. If it took ownership of
            the ECS service or ALB it'd be too risky to adopt - one bad plan
            could recreate a running service. Passing ARNs means the module only
            ever creates new CloudWatch resources, never modifies what's already
            there.

        <SubSectionHeading>
          Level 1 - infrastructure observability
        </SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The minimum useful configuration is just your service identity, the
          ALB and ECS ARNs, your log groups, and an SNS topic for alarm
          notifications.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={quickStart} />

        <Paragraph>
          This creates everything immediately. No application changes required
          at this level - just the ARNs of resources that already exist.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>Level 2 - canaries and tracing</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Add the <InlineHighlight>canaries</InlineHighlight> block for
          outside-in synthetic monitoring and the{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>tracing</InlineHighlight> block for Application
          Signals drilldowns. Both are optional and independent of each other.
        </Paragraph>

        >
          <Paragraph>
            Level 2 tracing requires your application to run the CloudWatch
            agent as a sidecar and instrument with ADOT. The module exposes
            trace drilldown links in the dashboard, but it cannot generate trace
            data for an application that doesn't emit any.
          </Paragraph>
        </Banner>

        <SectionHeading>Structured Logging</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          This is the one thing the module can't do for you. When I first wired
          the Logs Insights queries against a service that was using
          unstructured log lines, all ten queries returned nothing useful.
          Structured JSON is the price of admission - but it's a low bar and{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>console.log(JSON.stringify(...))</InlineHighlight> is
          genuinely all it takes.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={structuredLog} />

        <Paragraph>
          The demo backend uses a tiny helper that wraps{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>console.log</InlineHighlight> with JSON formatting.
          This is all that's needed to unlock all 10 saved queries.

        <SectionHeading>The Demo App</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The repo includes a complete demo stack under{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>examples/react-node-demo</InlineHighlight>. It's a
          realistic ECS target - React frontend, Node/Express backend, ALB -
          with the observability module wired against it. Its purpose is to
          prove the module works end to end and to give you a way to generate
          observable signals on demand.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>The backend API</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The backend is intentionally designed to generate observable signals.
          Every endpoint is there to trigger a specific alarm or log query, not
          to be a useful API.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={demoBackendEndpoints} />

        <Paragraph>
          Hitting <InlineHighlight>/api/fail</InlineHighlight> a handful of
          times will trigger the 5xx alarm. Hitting{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>/api/slow?ms=5000</InlineHighlight> repeatedly pushes
          the P99 latency alarm. The{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>/api/dependency</InlineHighlight> endpoint simulates
          a flaky downstream and shows up in the Application Signals service map
          when tracing is enabled.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>The React UI</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          I built the React UI because "open CloudWatch and wait for data" is a
          terrible way to validate a module during development. You need to be
          able to fire specific request patterns on demand and immediately see
          whether the right alarms trigger. The UI makes that fast - hit "Run
          burst", watch the error rate spike, confirm the 5xx alarm flips. It's
          a testing harness as much as a demo.
        </Paragraph>

        <Carousel
          items={[
            {
              title: "Demo UI overview",
              description:
                "Live stat cards, a traffic-path architecture diagram with animated request packets, and the package surface showing what the module created in CloudWatch. The Alarms node turns red when an alarm is in ALARM state.",

            {
              title: "Endpoints and signals",
              description:

            },
          ]}
        />

        <Paragraph>
          The architecture diagram animates request packets along the path from
          browser through CloudFront and ALB to the ECS service (and optionally
          to a downstream dependency). The packet turns red when the response is
          a 5xx. The Alarms node changes colour to reflect the current alarm
          state.

        <Banner title="Running locally" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            The demo frontend and backend can run locally without any AWS
            infrastructure. The backend is a plain Node/Express server and the
            frontend is a Vite app that proxies{" "}
            <InlineHighlight>/api</InlineHighlight> to{" "}

        <TertiaryHeading>Step 4 - Inspect the dashboard</TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Open the CloudWatch console and navigate to Dashboards. The module
          creates a single composed dashboard named after your service and
          environment. You'll see ALB front-door charts, ECS health, the alarm
          strip, and the latest structured error entries from your log groups -
          all in one view.
        </Paragraph>

        <TertiaryHeading>Step 5 - Run Logs Insights queries</TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>

        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>Limitations</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          v1 only handles ECS behind an ALB - EC2 and Fargate both work, but
          Lambda and API Gateway adapters aren't there yet. I drew the line
          there deliberately because I wanted to ship something complete rather
          than something half-finished across five compute types.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The Application Signals setup is also more involved than I'd like. You
          have to run a CloudWatch agent sidecar and instrument with ADOT, and
          AWS's Node ESM support is still limited enough that the demo backend
          uses CommonJS. That's an AWS constraint, not a module one, but it's
          worth knowing going in.
