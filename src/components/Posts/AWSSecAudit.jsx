          I've written a lot of theory posts about AWS security services - IAM,
          KMS, CloudTrail, VPC, Secrets Manager. I covered how they work, what
          the controls are, why they matter. I used this project as an excuse to
          see if I could build something useful which encapsulates the above.{" "}

          is a Node.js CLI that connects to your AWS account, runs 26 CIS
          Foundations Benchmark controls across six services, and gives you a
          grade.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The idea is simple enough to install in under a minute but structured
          around a real compliance framework - the CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
          v2.0 - so the findings map to something meaningful rather than being
          an arbitrary checklist which most likely people would not follow.
        </Paragraph>

        <ProjectArchitecture
          diagram={architectureFlow}
          summary="At a high level, the tool is a thin CLI orchestration layer around small AWS service check modules. The CLI owns arguments, credentials, concurrency, scoring, and output formatting. Each service module owns one thing: inspect a service and return findings in the same shape as every other module."
        >
          <Paragraph>
            That separation matters because it keeps the security rules, AWS API
            calls, scoring logic, and report rendering from bleeding into each
            other. Adding a new control should mostly mean adding a new check
            and metadata entry, not rewriting how the whole report works.
          </Paragraph>
        </ProjectArchitecture>

        <SectionHeading>What Is the CIS Benchmark?</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The Center for Internet Security publishes prescriptive configuration
          guides for cloud platforms. The AWS Foundations Benchmark is one of
          them: a numbered list of controls, each with a severity, a rationale,
          and a remediation procedure. Control 1.1 is "ensure MFA is enabled for
          the root account". Control 5.2 is "ensure no security groups allow
          unrestricted inbound SSH". The controls are publicly available, widely
          referenced, and mapped to SOC 2 and PCI DSS by compliance teams.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Using a real framework instead of inventing my own means the output is
          legible to anyone who's seen a security audit before, and it means
          every finding has a documented rationale rather than just my opinion.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>Installation and Usage</SectionHeading>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={installUsage} />

        <Paragraph>
          The tool uses the standard AWS SDK v3 credential chain - environment
          variables, shared credentials file, instance profiles, SSO - so
          however you authenticate to AWS today, it'll just pick that up.
        </Paragraph>

        <Banner title="Permissions required" variant="info">

            The audit needs read-only access across the six services it checks.

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={sampleOutput} />

        <Paragraph>
          Findings are grouped by service and sorted by severity within each
          group. Passing controls show alongside failing ones so you can see
          what's already in good shape. Resource identifiers - bucket names,
          security group IDs, secret ARNs - appear next to each finding so
          there's no ambiguity about what needs fixing.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>The Scoring System</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Each control has a weighted score based on severity. A passing
          Critical control contributes 10 points; a passing Low contributes 1.
          The final score is a 0-100 percentage of points earned versus points
          possible, which maps to a letter grade.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={scoringTable} />

        <Paragraph>
          Weighting by severity means a single open SSH security group moves the
          needle more than three buckets missing access logs - which reflects
          the actual risk difference between those two findings.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>Controls Covered</SectionHeading>

          Some findings have a safe, non-destructive remediation - enabling S3
          versioning, turning on KMS key rotation, activating CloudTrail log
          file validation. These can be applied automatically. Findings that
          require human judgment - revoking a public S3 bucket that might be
          serving content, removing a security group rule that might be
          intentional - are flagged but never touched automatically.

          Running on a schedule rather than on every push makes more sense for
          an account audit - your security posture doesn't change with every
          commit, but it can drift quietly over time if nobody's watching. A
          weekly run catches that drift before it accumulates.

        <ProjectCritique>
          <Paragraph>
            What I cared about most was false confidence. A security scanner
            that silently skips checks is worse than no scanner because it
            teaches you to trust an incomplete result. That is why permission
            errors and unexpected AWS responses are surfaced as UNKNOWN findings
            instead of being swallowed.
          </Paragraph>

          <Paragraph>
            The other production-style concern was blast radius. The CLI can run
            from a developer laptop or a scheduled CI job, so it has to be
            useful with read-only credentials. When remediation is enabled,
            dry-run output shows the exact planned changes before any write
            calls happen.

          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>Single region</Strong> - the audit targets one region per

          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>No AWS Organizations support</Strong> - scanning across
            multiple accounts requires running the tool with different assumed

          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>S3 MFA delete (CIS 2.1.3)</Strong> - enabling MFA delete
            requires root credentials and cannot be done programmatically via
            the SDK without them. The check detects the state correctly but{" "}

          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>No historical trending</Strong> - each run is a
            point-in-time snapshot. Storing results to S3 and diffing over time

        <ProjectNextSteps>
          <Paragraph>
            The next version I would build is less about adding more individual
            checks and more about making the audit useful across time and across
            accounts. Multi-region aggregation, AWS Organizations role fan-out,
            and historical score tracking would turn this from a point-in-time
            CLI into something closer to a lightweight security posture report.

            I would also add a stronger test harness around remediation logic.
            The risky part of a tool like this is not reading AWS state; it is
            proving that a suggested fix is scoped, predictable, and safe to run
            repeatedly. That is where I would spend effort before expanding the
            <InlineHighlight>--fix</InlineHighlight> surface area.

          The most useful thing about building this was running it against my
          own account. I had root MFA enabled, which I knew. I had an access key
          I'd forgotten about that was 140 days old! I had KMS key rotation
          disabled on two keys I'd created for a side project and never
          revisited. None of those are embarrassing findings individually, but
          seeing them all together with a score made the drift tangible in a way
          that reading theory posts never does.
