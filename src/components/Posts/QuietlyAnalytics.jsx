        <Paragraph>
          I was using Google Analytics on this portfolio and it bothered me more
          than it should have. Not for any deep privacy reason, not that I was
          sending every visitor's data to Google, just because it feels a little
          clunky and I could never find an implementation I was happy with. That
          lead me to asking my self the question - how hard is it to build my
          own? So I built <Strong>quiet-ly</Strong> instead: a self-hosted
          analytics stack that lives entirely in my own AWS account and costs
          nothing to run at portfolio traffic levels.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          It's split across two repos: a Terraform module that provisions the
          AWS backend, and an npm package that provides the browser SDK, React
          bindings, and a dashboard component. No cookies. No third-party
          requests on page load.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>The Stack</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          There are two repos and they map cleanly onto two concerns:
        </Paragraph>

        <TextList>
          <TextListItem>
            <TextLink href={terraformRepo} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              terraform-aws-quiet-ly
            </TextLink>{" "}
            - the AWS infrastructure. One Terraform module that provisions
            everything the backend needs: CloudFront, Lambda, DynamoDB, IAM, and
            CloudWatch.
          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <TextLink href={npmRepo} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
              @quiet-ly/analytics
            </TextLink>{" "}
            - the browser SDK. An npm package with three entry points: the core
            SDK, React bindings, and a ready-made dashboard component.
          </TextListItem>
        </TextList>

        <Paragraph>
          The two repos are intentionally decoupled. The Terraform module
          doesn't care what framework your frontend uses. The SDK doesn't know
          anything about how the backend is provisioned - it just sends a POST
          to a URL you give it.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>The Infrastructure</SectionHeading>

        <SubSectionHeading>What gets provisioned</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Running <InlineHighlight>terraform apply</InlineHighlight> creates
          five things in your AWS account:
        </Paragraph>

        <TextList>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>CloudFront distribution</Strong> - the public HTTPS entry
            point. It handles HTTPS redirect, IPv6, and most importantly,
            injects a{" "}
            <InlineHighlight>CloudFront-Viewer-Country</InlineHighlight> header
            on every request so the Lambda can record visitor location without
            any IP lookup.
          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>Lambda Function URL</Strong> - the actual handler. Sits
            behind CloudFront and deals with two operations: ingesting events
            (POST) and querying them back (GET). No API Gateway - Lambda
            Function URLs give you a free HTTPS endpoint with built-in CORS.
          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>DynamoDB table</Strong> - single-table design with two
            Global Secondary Indexes. Pay-per-request billing means you pay
            nothing when traffic is zero.
          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>IAM role</Strong> - scoped to the minimum:
            <InlineHighlight>dynamodb:PutItem</InlineHighlight> and{" "}
            <InlineHighlight>dynamodb:Query</InlineHighlight> on the events
            table only.
          </TextListItem>
          <TextListItem>
            <Strong>CloudWatch log group</Strong> - Lambda logs with
            configurable retention. Defaults to 30 days.
          </TextListItem>
        </TextList>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={architecture} />

        <Banner title="Why no API Gateway?" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            My first draft used API Gateway and it added cost and configuration
            for literally nothing. Lambda Function URLs give you a free HTTPS
            endpoint with built-in CORS. The only reason to add CloudFront on
            top is the country header injection - if I didn't want location data
            I'd just expose the Function URL directly.
          </Paragraph>
        </Banner>

        <SubSectionHeading>Quick start</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Point the module at your origin and run apply. You get back an
          endpoint URL to hand to the SDK.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={terraformQuickStart} />
        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={terraformApply} />

        <SubSectionHeading>DynamoDB design</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The table uses a single-table design with three access patterns built
          in. Every event is written once but can be queried three ways: by app
          + date, by event type + date, or by page path + date.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={dynamoDesign} />

        <Paragraph>
          The partition key always includes the date so queries are bounded to
          one day at a time. The dashboard fans out a query-per-date for the
          selected date range and merges the results client-side.
        </Paragraph>

        <Banner title="Single-table design" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            I originally had separate tables for events, sessions, and visitors.
            Joining them for the dashboard meant multiple round trips and
            awkward client-side merging. Collapsing everything into one table
            with GSIs fixed that - one query per date gets everything the
            dashboard needs.
          </Paragraph>
        </Banner>

        <SubSectionHeading>The Lambda handler</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The handler has one job per HTTP method. A POST writes an event to
          DynamoDB. A GET queries events back. OPTIONS returns CORS headers and
          exits immediately.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          The handler is written as a factory function (
          <InlineHighlight>createHandler</InlineHighlight>) that accepts an
          optional DynamoDB client and country lookup function. This makes it
          unit-testable without mocking modules.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>Country enrichment</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          This was the thing I was most pleased to discover. CloudFront
          automatically injects a{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>CloudFront-Viewer-Country</InlineHighlight> header on
          every request - a two-letter ISO country code based on the origin IP.
          The Lambda just reads it. No MaxMind database, no geolocation API, no
          extra cost.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          If you skip CloudFront (
          <InlineHighlight>enable_cloudfront = false</InlineHighlight>), the
          header isn't there and <InlineHighlight>country</InlineHighlight>{" "}
          stores as an empty string. The dashboard falls back to timezone for
          location display in that case.
        </Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>The NPM Package</SectionHeading>

        <SubSectionHeading>Installation</SubSectionHeading>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={npmInstall} />

        <Paragraph>
          The package has three entry points:{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>@quiet-ly/analytics</InlineHighlight> for the core
          SDK, <InlineHighlight>@quiet-ly/analytics/react</InlineHighlight> for
          the React provider and hooks, and{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>@quiet-ly/analytics/dashboard</InlineHighlight> for
          the pre-built dashboard component.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>Core SDK</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The <InlineHighlight>Analytics</InlineHighlight> class is the main
          entry point. You initialise it once with your endpoint and app ID,
          then call methods on it wherever you need to track something.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={coreUsage} />

        <Paragraph>
          Every call to <InlineHighlight>pageview()</InlineHighlight> or{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>track()</InlineHighlight> constructs a payload and
          hands it to an internal queue. The queue batches and retries sends so
          a slow network doesn't block the user's UI.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={analyticsClass} />

        <Banner title="Visitor and session IDs without cookies" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            I didn't want to set cookies just to track sessions - that triggers
            consent banners and I wanted to avoid the whole thing. The SDK uses{" "}
            <InlineHighlight>localStorage</InlineHighlight> for a stable visitor
            ID and <InlineHighlight>sessionStorage</InlineHighlight> for a
            session ID that resets when the tab closes. It's not perfect
            fingerprinting but it's good enough for a portfolio dashboard, and
            it requires no consent prompt.
          </Paragraph>
        </Banner>

        <SubSectionHeading>React integration</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The React entry point exports three things: an{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>AnalyticsProvider</InlineHighlight> that initialises
          the SDK once at the root, a{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>usePageTracking</InlineHighlight> hook that fires a
          pageview on every route change, and a{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>useAnalytics</InlineHighlight> hook that gives any
          component access to the SDK instance.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={reactProvider} />

        <Paragraph>
          This portfolio uses the SDK slightly differently - it calls{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>Analytics.pageview()</InlineHighlight> and{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>Analytics.track()</InlineHighlight> directly in each
          blog post component so every post can attach a{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>slug</InlineHighlight> property to the event. That
          means the dashboard can break down views per post rather than just per
          path.
        </Paragraph>

        <SubSectionHeading>Dashboard component</SubSectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The dashboard entry point exports a single{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>AnalyticsDashboard</InlineHighlight> component. Drop
          it in anywhere, point it at your endpoint and app ID, and it handles
          the rest.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={dashboardUsage} />

        <Paragraph>The dashboard includes:</Paragraph>

        <SectionHeading>How It All Fits Together</SectionHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Walking through a single page view end to end helps make the moving
          parts concrete.
        </Paragraph>

        <TertiaryHeading>Step 1: The browser sends an event</TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          When a user navigates to a page, the SDK constructs a payload from
          browser APIs - the current path, the referrer, the user's timezone and
          locale, and the session and visitor IDs - then POSTs it to your
          CloudFront endpoint.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={lambdaIngest} />

        <TertiaryHeading>
          Step 2: CloudFront enriches the request
        </TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          Before the request reaches Lambda, CloudFront injects{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>CloudFront-Viewer-Country</InlineHighlight> based on
          the request's origin IP. This is free and happens at the CDN layer -
          the Lambda doesn't need to do any geolocation work.
        </Paragraph>

        <TertiaryHeading>Step 3: Lambda writes to DynamoDB</TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          The handler validates the three required fields (
          <InlineHighlight>appId</InlineHighlight>,{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>type</InlineHighlight>,{" "}
          <InlineHighlight>timestamp</InlineHighlight>), reads the country
          header, generates a unique event ID, and writes one item to DynamoDB
          with all three key patterns set.
        </Paragraph>

        <TertiaryHeading>Step 4: The dashboard queries it back</TertiaryHeading>

        <Paragraph>
          When the dashboard loads, it fires GET requests for each date in the
          selected range. The Lambda queries DynamoDB using the app + date
          partition key and returns the raw event list. The dashboard component
          handles all the aggregation and display logic client-side.
        </Paragraph>

        <CodeBlockWithCopy code={lambdaQuery} />

        <Banner title="Query endpoint is opt-out" variant="info">
          <Paragraph>
            The GET endpoint is enabled by default but can be disabled with{" "}
            <InlineHighlight>enable_query_endpoint = false</InlineHighlight> in
            the Terraform module. Useful if you only want ingest and plan to
            query DynamoDB directly.

        </Banner>

        <SectionHeading>Wrapping Up</SectionHeading>

          Building this taught me more about DynamoDB access patterns than any
          tutorial I've read. There's something about designing for your own
          real data - knowing exactly what queries the dashboard needs - that
          makes the single-table tradeoffs click in a way they don't when you're
          following a contrived example.

          If I were to change one thing it'd be the dashboard query approach.
          Fanning out one DynamoDB query per day works fine for 30 days but
          starts to feel clunky at longer ranges. A proper time-series index or
          aggregation layer would fix that, but it'd also make the Lambda
          considerably more complicated for a portfolio project.

          Both repos are open source if you want to use the stack or dig into
          the implementation.
